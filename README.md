# TFX - *Next Generation Theatre Software*

## What is TFX - *Next Generation Theatre Software* and it's goal?

TFX also known as Theatre Effects, is a Next Generation Theatre Free and Open Source Software Project developed with [JUCE](https://www.JUCE.com).  The goal of this project is to develop a application that Theatrical Technicians and Designers can rely on to run all departments of a production at the Local Small to Mid-Size Theatre level.  This application will include after much development the following:

- A Cross-Platform Nature that can work on Mac OSX, Linux OS, and Windows OS
- A Collaborative Nature where theatrical designers and technicians can work on a single show file over a Local Area Network, with a Client-Server Style System, which will have redundancy in case one machine fails
- A Programmable Nature that different "modules" of the program can be added to any given workspace, with the option to create new Modules/Plugins
- Basic to Advanced Audiovisual editing and playback
- Multi-Channel Device I/O and Control
- Remote Show Control such as Open Sound Control and Midi Show Control
- 3D - Environment Preview / Magic Sheet with Assets for Audio, Digital Media, Lighting, and Sets

## How will this project be accomplished?

This project will be accomplished one step at a time by many people doing the best they can do with their limited time.  The outline for this follows:

1. Develop a Modular GUI that starts with only one module, the Audio Playback Module
2. Develop a way to save a list of Audio Playback Cues into a JSON-formatted file
3. Develop a way to create Audio Playback Cues quickly and easily both through a GUI Button, 
and a always listening GUI command line simalar to the EOS Command Line
4. Develop a way of viewing all Cues at once either in a List or Timeline
5. Develop the editing capabilty one feature at a time to the Audio Playback Module
    ---
6. Develop more built-in modules
7. Develop the ability to create modules inside the application
    ---
8. Develop the Client-Server System 
        NOTE:  To Be Discussed.
9. Develop the 3D Environment Preview / Magic Sheet 
        NOTE: To Be Discussed.
        
NOTE: This the general main objectives to follow, see the [Project Board](https://github.com/ethanpvr18/TFX/projects/1) for detailed tasks.
